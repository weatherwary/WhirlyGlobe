`brew install appledoc` not working ("Error: appledoc has been disabled because it does not build!")

This works:
`git clone git://github.com/tomaz/appledoc.git`
`appledoc/install-appledoc.sh`

But the above produces:
"ERROR | !> xcrun: error: unable to find utility "docsetutil", not a developer tool or in PATH"

Apparently docsetutil was removed in XCode 9.3

I wasn't able to get any results with the instructions at:

Closest I got was:

$ cd ios/library/WhirlyGlobe-MaplyComponent
$ jazzy --objc --umbrella-header include/WhirlyGlobe-Maply-Umbrella.h --sdk iphoneos --framework-root . --module WhirlyGlobe-MaplyComponent
.../include/MaplySharedAttributes.h:21:9: fatal error: could not build module 'Foundation'
