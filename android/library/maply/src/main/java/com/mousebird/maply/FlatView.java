/**
 * The flat view implements a top down orthogonal projection
 *     which is prefect for doing a straight up 2D map.
 *     It thinks more like a window in that it's trying to
 *     display the full extents (as passed in) within a large window
 *     (also passed in) but only showing a smaller window within that.
 *     We presume the caller will move that smaller window around, thus
 *     changing our model and projection matrices.
